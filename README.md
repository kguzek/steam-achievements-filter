# Steam Achievements Filter

This Firefox extension allows you to hide achievements which require you to have specific DLC.

## Usage

Right now, this extension only contains support for Euro Truck Simulator 2. You select the DLC you have, and then the steam achievements page will not show achievements which do not require DLC you don't have.

To do this, simply select the extension icon, select the DLC, and click `apply`.
